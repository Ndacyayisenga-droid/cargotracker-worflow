== Domain Events

Some things clearly have identity but no life-cycle, or an extremely limited 
life-cycle with just one state. We call these things Domain Events and they 
can be viewed as a hybrid of Entities and Value Objects.

In our application, 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/handling/HandlingEvent.java[HandlingEvent] 
is a Domain Event that represents a real-life event such as cargo being loaded 
or unloaded, customs cleared, etc. They carry both a completion time and a 
registration time. The completion time is the time when the event occurred, 
and the registration time is the time when the event was received by the 
system. The HandlingEvent ID is composed of the cargo, voyage, completion 
time, location, and type (LOAD, UNLOAD, etc).

Domain Events are usually implemented as Jakarta Persistence (JPA) entities.
