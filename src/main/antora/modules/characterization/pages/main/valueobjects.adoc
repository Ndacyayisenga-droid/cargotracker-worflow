== Value Objects

A https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/cargo/Leg.java[Leg] 
consists of a starting point and an ending point (to 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/location/Location.java[Location] 
and from 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/location/Location.java[Location]), 
and a reference to a voyage. A leg has no sense of identity; two legs with the 
same from location, end location, and voyage are in our model completely 
interchangeable. As a result, we implement Leg as an immutable Value Object.

An 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/cargo/Itinerary.java[Itinerary] 
consists of a list of Legs, with the load location of the first leg in the 
list as the starting point of the itinerary and the unload location of the 
last leg as the final destination. The same reasoning applies to itineraries 
as to Legs: they do not have identity and are implemented as Value Objects. 
Now, a cargo can certainly have its itinerary updated. One way to accomplish 
this would be to keep the original itinerary instance and update the Legs in 
the itinerary's list. In this case, the itinerary must be mutable and has to be 
implemented as an entity. With the itinerary as a Value Object, as in the case 
of our application model and implementation, updating it is a simple operation 
of acquiring a complete new itinerary from the 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/service/RoutingService.java[RoutingService] 
and replacing the old one. Implementation of a cargo's itinerary management is 
much simplified by having the itinerary as a Value Object.

Value Objects are typically implemented as Jakarta Persistence (JPA) embedded 
objects. However, it is sometimes useful and valid to implement them as 
Jakarta Persistence (JPA) entities.
