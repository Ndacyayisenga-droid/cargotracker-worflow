== Repositories

With the aggregates and their roots identified, it is fairly trivial to 
identify the Repositories. Repositories retrieve and save aggregate roots from 
and to persistent storage. In our application, there is one Repository per 
aggregate root. For example, the 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/cargo/CargoRepository.java[CargoRepository] 
is responsible for finding and storing cargo aggregates. The finders return 
Cargo instances or lists of Cargo instances.

While Repository interfaces are part of the domain layer, their 
implementations are part of the infrastructure layer. For example, the 
CargoRepository has a Jakarta Persistence (JPA) implementation in the 
infrastructure layer, 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/infrastructure/persistence/jpa/JpaCargoRepository.java[JpaCargoRepository].

Repositories in Jakarta EE are typically implemented using Jakarta 
Persistence (JPA) and CDI. The Jakarta Data is particularly helpful in 
implementing repositories.
