== Application Services

Application services represent the high-level business operations for the 
system and constitute the application layer. They provide a high-level 
abstraction for clients to use when interacting with the domain. The 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/application[org.eclipse.cargotracker.application] 
package contains all the services for the application, such as 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/application/BookingService.java[BookingService]
and 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/application/HandlingEventService.java[HandlingEventService]. 
The application services are a natural place to apply concerns such as pooling, 
transactions, and security. This is why application services are typically 
implemented using Enterprise Beans (EJB) or transactional CDI beans.

In some situations, e.g., when dealing with graphs of lazy-loaded domain 
objects or when passing services' return values over network boundaries, the 
services are wrapped in facades. The facades handle ORM session management 
issues and/or convert the domain objects to more portable Data Transfer 
Objects (DTOs) that can be tailored to specific use cases. In that case, we 
consider the DTO-serializing facade part of the interfaces layer. See 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/booking/facade/BookingServiceFacade.java[BookingServiceFacade] 
for an example.

== Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs are lightweight objects that represent the data needed to transfer
