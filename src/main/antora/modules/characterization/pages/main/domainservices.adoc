== Domain Services

Domain services encapsulate key domain concepts that are not naturally modeled 
as things. However, domain service method arguments and return values are 
usually domain classes. Sometimes only the service interface (what the service 
does) is part of the domain layer, but the implementation (how the service 
does it) is part of the infrastructure layer. This is analogous to how 
repository interfaces are part of the domain layer, but the Jakarta 
Persistence (JPA) implementations are not.

A good example of this is the 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/service/RoutingService.java[RoutingService], 
which provides access to the routing system and is used to find possible 
routes for a given specification. The implementation, 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/infrastructure/routing/ExternalRoutingService.java[ExternalRoutingService], 
communicates with another system and translates to/from an external API/data 
model in the infrastructure layer.

On the other hand, if the service can be implemented strictly using the domain 
layer, both the interface and the implementation could be part of the domain 
layer.
