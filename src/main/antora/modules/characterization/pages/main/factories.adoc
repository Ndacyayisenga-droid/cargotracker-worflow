== Factories

In some cases, creating entities is not as trivial as simply calling the `new` 
operator. In such cases, you will want to encapsulate entity creation using 
Factories. In our application, 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/domain/model/handling/HandlingEventFactory.java[HandlingEventFactory] 
is used to create handling events.

Factories are typically implemented using CDI.
