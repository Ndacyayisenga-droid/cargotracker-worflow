= Jakarta EE and DDD

As the name implies, Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software design 
and development that focuses on the core domain and domain logic. The domain 
is implemented through a careful focus on traditional OOAD (Object Oriented 
Analysis and Design) and modeling the real world problem the software is 
trying to solve as closely as possible.

The basic building blocks of the domain are entities, value objects, 
aggregates, services, repositories, and factories. The 
xref:characterization:main/main.adoc[Characterization] section overviews how 
these concepts are implemented in the application using Jakarta EE. Logical 
layers partitioning distinct concerns are super-imposed on the core concept of 
the domain. These layers generally consist of the UI/interface layer, the 
application layer, the domain layer (of course!), and the infrastructure 
layer respectively. The xref:layers:main/main.adoc[Layers] section explains 
the architectural layers in the application and how they relate to various 
Jakarta EE APIs.
