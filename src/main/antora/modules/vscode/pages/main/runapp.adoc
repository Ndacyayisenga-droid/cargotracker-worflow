== Running the Application
You will now need to get the application into Visual Studio Code. Go to 
File -> Open Folder -> Select the root directory of the Cargo Tracker project 
in your file system, and hit finish. Visual Studio Code will automatically 
identify it as a Maven project. It will take a few minutes to import the 
project for the first time.

After the project loads, go to the Maven tab on the left bottom side. You will 
see that Eclipse Cargo Tracker is a recognized Maven project. Right click on 
it and run the 'clean' Maven command. Finally, run the 'package' Maven command. 
It will take a while the very first time as Maven downloads dependencies.

After this, a war file named 'cargo-tracker.war' will be built under the 
'target' directory. Right-click on the war file and select the 'Run on Payara 
Server' option.

The first time start up might take a bit of time. Once the deployment is done, 
Visual Studio Code will automatically open up a default browser window with 
the application.

There is a tracking interface to track the current status of cargo and a 
booking interface to book and route cargo. You should explore both interfaces 
before diving into the code. You should also check out the 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/handling/rest/HandlingReportService.java[REST] 
and 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/handling/file/UploadDirectoryScanner.java[file processing] 
interfaces to register handling events as well as the mobile web interface. 
You can test against the REST interfaces using our 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/test/soapui[soapUI tests].

Once you are done, click on the 'x' icon on the Payara server instance to stop 
the Cargo Tracker application.
