== Cloud Demo

Cargo Tracker is deployed to Kubernetes on the cloud using GitHub Actions 
workflows. You can find the demo deployment on the Scaleforce cloud at 
https://cargo-tracker.j.scaleforce.net. This project is very thankful to our 
sponsors https://jelastic.com/[Jelastic] and 
https://www.scaleforce.net/[Scaleforce] for hosting the demo! The deployment 
and all data is refreshed nightly.
