Before exploring the code, it may be helpful to view a demo of the application 
functionality. The video below demos the major functionality of the Eclipse 
Cargo Tracker application. It is intended to be a helpful point to start 
exploring how the application implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) using 
Jakarta EE.

The following is the functionality highlighted in the demo:

* Tracking cargo using the public interface
* Monitoring cargo using both the static dashboard and live map
* Booking and routing cargo
* Registering cargo life-cycle events using the mobile interface
* Registering cargo life-cycle events in bulk using the batch file processing 
  interface
