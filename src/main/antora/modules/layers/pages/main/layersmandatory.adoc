== Are Layers Mandatory?

Very few things in DDD are mandatory, and layering is no exception. You should 
use layers if you believe they add value in keeping your application 
maintainable. Indeed, even if you do choose to use layers, you do not need to 
use them everywhere in your application as an absolute requirement.

If you look closely at the application as well as the opening image in this 
section, it is perfectly OK to skip layers per use case. For example, it is 
quite common for the interface layer to skip the application layer and 
communicate directly with the domain layer. In many other cases, having a 
layer will clearly add value by separating concerns, improving testability, 
reducing coupling, and enhancing semantic clarity. A helpful example of this 
is the

implementation.
